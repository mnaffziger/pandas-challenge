    "    Overall, a large majority of the district's school students are passing their math or reading exams, 75% and 86% respectfully.  However, only 65% of all district students are passing both their math and reading exams. In addition, math scores are generally lower than the reading scores.\n",

    "    Analysis by grade level:\n",
    "        For each school, the average scores are rather consistant across the grade level for math and reading. \n",
    "        Average math scores are still lower than average reading scores\n",
    "\n",
    "    Analysis by school spending:\n",
    "        Charter schools have a smaller budget (per student) than district schools\n",
    "        District schools spend more perstudent than charter schools\n",
    "        Spending more per student did not correspond to higher overall passing rates\n",
    "                \n",
    "    Analysis by school size:\n",
    "        Schools that have 2000 or less students have higher overall passing rates\n",
    "        The largest charter school has less students than the smallest district school\n",
    "\n",
    "    Analysis by school type:\n",
    "        Charter school have a drastically higher overall passing rate (90%) than district schools(54%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion/Conclusion\n",
    "    The data analysis represented here clearly suggests two things:\n",
    "        1. Schools with less students perform better in assessments\n",
    "        2. Charter schools are better at utilizing their resources (budget) in educating their students- as evidenced in a drastically higher overall passing rates compared to distric schools\n",
    "    Though these trends appear clear, they should be analyzed furthur before reporting this information to governing bodies/stakeholers.  For instance, when the average math and reading scores were calculated, the student population was not directly considered.  These geometric means were considered at equal weight- eventhough the charter schools routinely have lower student couonts than the distric schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In addition, demographics are not included in the original student/school csv files.  There is no data citing how many teachers a school has per grade, or how many students are in a classroom.  This data supports the generally held practice that smaller class sizes lead to better student performance/learning.  However this information is only inferred because of the smaller charter school student body.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In addition to basic school demographics, this data does not reflect any admission requirements for the charter schools:\n",
    "        -Is the incomming class chosen from a lottery of applicants?\n",
    "        -Is an entrance exam/aptitude test score required to gain enrollment?\n",
    "        -Is admission based on the region directly surrounding the school?\n",
    "    Many of these factors place undue hardships on students/families leaving the only option as an overcrwoded district school, and culls highly performing students into the charter school system- which can disappropriates resources from district schools.\n",
